Full Project Proposal 

# Roadmap Sparta: My Journey to Sparta, Greece

## Roadmap Sparta will be part blog, describing my personal expereinces with Spartan obstacle course races, and part training resource.

## Most people don't just wake up one morning and decide to run a minimum of 5k with roughly 20 obstacles along the way. There is planning and preperation that needs to happen first.  

## Objectives
- Design a website that discusses all the different aspects of the race
- Have both people who have done Spartan races and who haven't review the content

## Expected Outcomes
- A prototype website
