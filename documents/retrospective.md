# What Went Well
I am happy with my ability to implement the HTML and CSS code from the course lessons, as well as new things I learned on my own, to have a protype website that shows a variety of skills and a solid foundational understanding. 




# What Went Wrong
 Pretty much everything besides the HTML and CSS aspects of this project was a struggle. I had a very hard time writing the supporting documents to go along with my prototype website and ofte had to force myself to stop messing with the code and work on the written aspects. 
 
 I also found GitHub to not be very user friendly. I struggled, even with the tutorials, to get my published site to display the same as just viewing my HTML files live. 




# What Would I Do Differently
With this project I created each page/file at a time and then pushed the changes to GitHub. Doing it this way I found my self getting very frustrated because it did not update in real time. I would refresh my webpage and if it was not displaying properly I would go over and over the code, not finding the problem, and it was just a time delay. With future project I will probably develop all of my content, push it all at once, and then just troubleshoot it all together.
