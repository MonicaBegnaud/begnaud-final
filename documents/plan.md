# Risk Assessment

## Identified Risks
1. Accuracy of the content
- My experiences could differ from others
- Workout advise might not suit the reader's personal fitness level
- Race obstacles may be updated or change based on locations I have not race at.
2. Visibility and Engagement 
- Lots of free training guides currently avail, including from Spartan themselves 
- Users may expect a more customized experience where they can design their own plans instead of following mine
3. Liability
- Relies on the user being safe, could follow exercise advise incorrectly and injury themselves

| Risk       | Impact | Probability| Score |
|------------|--------|------------|-------|
| Accuracy   |   4    |     5      |  20   |
| Visibility |   2    |     5      |  10   |
| Liability  |   5    |     5      |  25   |

### Mitigation Strategies 
#### To handle both the accuracy and liability risks I will take the same approaches. 
- Transfer: The website will include repeated disclaimers that these are these are my personal experiences and should not be taken as medical advice and the official Spartan website should be used to verify information.
#### I will just accept the visibility risk. I am not overly concerned with the number of people who view my website. It's primary purpose will be documenting my experiences and for other to use it as a guideline/motivation. If it doesn't work for a certain audience it doesn't work.
